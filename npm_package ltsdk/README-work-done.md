# Work Done Till Now

## Project Context & Goals

This project demonstrates a real, live integration between an Open edX LMS instance and the Learning Tokens SDK (LT-SDK). The SDK is designed to fetch, process, and aggregate learning data from Open edX using real API calls (no mocks), enabling analytics and tokenization workflows.

## Key Files & Their Purpose

| File/Folder                | Purpose                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `src/edxDataprocessor.ts`  | Main Open edX API functions and data processing logic.                  |
| `src/index.ts`             | Exports all SDK functions for use elsewhere.                            |
| `types/edx.d.ts`           | TypeScript interfaces for Open edX data (courses, users, grades, etc.). |
| `tests/edxDataprocessor.test.ts` | Real API integration tests (using `.env` for credentials).         |
| `.env`                     | Stores API credentials and config (not committed to git).               |

## Step-by-Step Demo Flow

### 1. Environment Setup
- Configure `.env` with Open edX API credentials and course/user info.
- All credentials and config are loaded from environment variables for security and flexibility.

### 2. Open edX Instance
- Local Open edX LMS and Studio are running.
- Admin and learner users are created.
- At least one course with published content and a quiz/problem is available.

### 3. API Integration (SDK Functions)
- Obtain access tokens for admin and learners using the SDK.
- Fetch courses, enrollments, user profiles, and grades using SDK functions.
- Example usage:
  ```typescript
  import { getEdxCourses, getEdxUserProfile, getEdxCourseGrade } from './src/edxDataprocessor';
  // ...use these functions with real tokens
  ```
- Each function maps directly to a real Open edX API endpoint.

### 4. Data Processing & Learning Tokens
- Use `processEdxData` to aggregate user progress, grades, and eligibility for tokens.
- Example:
  ```typescript
  import { processEdxData } from './src/edxDataprocessor';
  // processEdxData(courseId, accessToken)
  ```
- This function combines participants, assessments, and grades to prepare for tokenization.

### 5. Postman Collection (Optional)
- Saved Postman requests for each API endpoint allow independent testing.

## APIs Integrated and Tested

- **Token (OAuth2) API**: Get access tokens for users.
- **Courses API**: List all courses.
- **Enrollment API**: Enroll users and check enrollments.
- **User Profile API**: Fetch user details.
- **Course Grades API**: Fetch user's grade in a course.

**APIs attempted but not fully working yet:**
- **Blocks API**: Not returning data due to future release date or Open edX quirks.
- **Submissions, Certificates, Analytics, User Progress APIs**: Not yet fully tested or may require additional configuration.

---

## Known Issues / Limitations

- **Blocks API returns empty:** Likely due to future release date or Open edX quirks.
- **Grades API returns 404:** If user is not enrolled or hasn't attempted any assessment, no grade is available.
- **Submissions API:** May not be enabled or may require additional configuration.
- **Certificates/Analytics:** Not all endpoints may be available or populated in a fresh Open edX install.

---

## Next Steps

- Adjust course release dates and republish to enable full API access.
- Enable and test additional APIs (submissions, certificates, analytics, user progress).
- Integrate Learning Tokens smart contract logic for issuing tokens based on real learning achievements.
- Expand test coverage and add more real-world scenarios.

## Summary

This project provides a working bridge between Open edX and the Learning Tokens SDK. All data is live, all logic is modular, and the foundation is set for advanced analytics, rewards, and blockchain integration.
